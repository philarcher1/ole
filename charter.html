However, the key area of content licensing has not been addressed in Web standards to date. Content licenses express the terms of usage for content for end users. With a standard vocabulary for license terminology content owners can express terms and processing systems can determine what permissions and other terms are associated with a given resource. End users can then be made aware of any usage conditions associated with that content.</p><p>A license expression system should provide a flexible and interoperable information model that supports transparent and innovative (re)use of digital content across all sectors and communities. The underlying model should be targeted to support the business models of open, educational, government, and commercial communities through profiles that enhance the model to align to their requirements whilst providing a common semantic layer for wider interoperability.</p><p>A license expression covers detailed terms that are both machine-processable and understandable for human-consumption. That is, each term (whether it is a allowable action, a constraint, or a requirement that needs to be meet, etc.) is expressed at the <strong>atomic</strong> level. This enables complex and business-specific expressions to be created from a vocabulary of terms, each of which provides different license semantics. This form of license expression addresses a different business/user need than other existing licensing platforms, such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> that provide a small number of <strong>instant</strong> licenses based solely on an identifier (i.e. URL) and legal textual documentation.</p>      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">Open License Expression Working Group</a>, part of the <a href="">Data Activity</a>, is to define a semantic data model for expressing license      statements for digital content, and define the technical elements to make      it deployable across browsers and content systems. </p>      <div class="noprint">        <p class="join">@@@Join the Open License Expression Working Group@@@.</p>      </div>      <table class="summary-table">        <tbody>          <tr id="Duration">            <th rowspan="1" colspan="1">End date</th>            <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 December 2017</td>          </tr>          <tr>            <th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Confidentiality</th>            <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proceedings are <a href="/2005/10/Process-20051014/comm.html#confidentiality-levels"                shape="rect">                public </a></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial Chairs</th>            <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Renato Iannella, <a href="http://semanticidentity.com/">Semantic                Identity</a><br />              A.N.

The ODRL work began 15 years ago and has been evolving the specification to meet industry and community requirements with wide scale adoption (for example in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/profile/oma/">mobile sector</a>). Over the past few years the group transformed into the W3C ODRL Community Group and has created five updated Version 2.1 specifications (an information model, vocabulary, XML encoding, JSON encoding, and ontology). The current ODRL specifications are deployed as profiles by business sectors, for example the <a href="http://dev.iptc.org/RightsML-Work-in-Progress">IPTC has adopted ODRL</a> for licensing online news articles.</p><p>The Open License Expression Working Group will take into account any additional needs of the wider community including commercial and non-commercial publishers, consumers and re-users of human readable content and machine readable data. In addition, implementation feedback from related license expression languages and initiatives will be considered in the final deliverables. For example, <a href="http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/"><abbr title="Open Data Rights Statements">ODRS</abbr></a> and <a href="https://www.useplus.com/">PLUS photo licensing</a>.</p><p>In order to address the needs of atomic license expressions, this working group will work on deliverables focused in the following approaches:</p><ul><li>semantic Information Model: An abstract information model for license statements;</li><li>vocabulary: A precise vocabulary defining the information model and its elements;</li><li>serializations: one or more serialization formats of the information model and vocabulary, such as XML, RDF/OWL, JSON/JSON-LD.</li></ul><p>This work will take the form of several specifications as Recommendation Track documents and where possible, this working group will collaborate with other working groups to fulfill the goals of these deliverables.</p>      </div>      <div class="scope">        <h2 id="noscope">Out of Scope</h2>        <p>The Open License Expression Working Group will <strong>not</strong> be considering:          <ul>            <li>access control mechanisms</li>            <li>digital rights management</li>            <li>enforcement mechanisms</li>            <li>jurisdictional legal issues</li>          </ul>        </p>       </div>      <div>        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>        <p>The titles of the deliverables are not final; the Working Group will          have to decide on the final titles as well as the structures of the          documents.

To get the most out of this work, participants should expect to devote several hours a week; for budgeting purposes, we recommend at least half a day a week. For chairs and document editors the commitment will be higher, say, 1-2 days a week. Participants who follow the work less closely should be aware that if they miss decisions through inattention further discussion of those issues may be ruled out of order. However, most participants follow some areas of discussion more closely than others, and the time needed to stay in good standing therefore varies from week to week. The Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for each specification.</p>    </div>    <div class="communication">      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>      <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the @@@public mailing        list@@@.
